## How to use

1- check the _variables.scss file and configure the best way for your project.

2- in the site folder, check what you will need for your project, if you don't need something delete it and if you need something, you create a file with the same naming pattern. Don't forget to import your new files (or delete the import of any scss files you deleted) into the style.scss file.
